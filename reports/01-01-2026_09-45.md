## What was done

- Added `bin` entries to `package.json` mapping the commands `one-typer-4-all`, `mytyper`, `onetyper`, and `onetyper4all` to `./src/cli.js`.
- Added corresponding npm script aliases for direct execution via `npm run <command>`.
- Created a `.gitignore` file to exclude `node_modules/` and `dist/` directories.
- Created a `CHANGELOG.md` documenting the new feature with proper commit emoji.
- Initialized a git repository, staged the changes, and committed with the message `:sparkles: feat add bin entries and script aliases for global CLI execution`.

## Why it was done

The user requested the ability to execute the CLI globally using commands like `one-typer-4-all`, `mytyper`, `onetyper`, or `onetyper4all` via `npx` or direct command. Adding a `bin` field in `package.json` registers these commands for npm, allowing global installation (`npm i -g .`) or execution via `npx`. The script aliases provide convenient shortcuts for local development.
